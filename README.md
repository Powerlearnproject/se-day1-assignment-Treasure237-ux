Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
ans: software engineering is the development and maintaining of software to solve some common human problems.
ans: it's important in the technology industry because it's helps in maintaining its software and developing new softwares

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
ans:1.in developing software 2.maintaining software 3.improving the ability of the software to carry out it tasks 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
ans:first think of what you what to create, what problem you want to solve, then analyse it, then what are the requirements, then product design, then product development which is the coding part, then text running the product, if it works fine, then go ahead and published it or upload it on app store or play store 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
ans: a software developer is in charge of the coding aspect, the outcome of the software, while a quality assurance engineer ensures it's has a good quality, while the product managers manages the product 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
ans: frustration when a code expected to be working turns out having errors, what you should do is to look for the error line, or go through the program again 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
ans:its the writing of special codes and algorithm to an artificial intelligence for it to produce an accurate response 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
